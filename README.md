# Horiseon Official Website

## Project

Horiseon is an SEO, online reputation management, and social media marketing service. For this project, I have updated their codebase by adding accessibility features, giving it a descriptive title, and making the code more concise. There was a broken link in the header that is now working. I added semantic HTML elements to make the code easier to follow for the next person who works on it. I also condensed the CSS to make it more logical and concise.

## Usage

This project is intended to be viewed by people who are searching for a company to help them with SEO, online reputation management, and social media marketing. The addition of accessiblilty features should make the site easier to find for potential customers and should also make the experience of using the site better for people with disabilities.

## Credits

I would like to thank all of my collegues for keeping up a lively discussion during this project. specifically, I want to thank Andrew Yen, Amalia Hay, Cyrus Jose, and Ian Martinez for participating with me in a workshopping section that greatly clarified my thought process. Thank you also to Thor Nolan, my tutor.

I read and watched a variety of articles on W3 and Codecademy for inspiration and guidance. Here is a link to a Codecademy video I found particularly helpful: <https://youtu.be/uxmB8MlO3m8.>
